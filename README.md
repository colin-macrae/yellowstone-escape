# ajax-project

A web application on things to do at Yellowstone National Park, which allows users to save activities of interest and write notes to their saved activities

This project was an assignment I (Colin) completed during the sixth (of 14) week of my accelerated web development learning program at LearningFuze.  We were tasked with designing the project from the ground up, including choosing an API, choosing the focus/purpose of the app, and creating the UX/UI with Figma.

I chose the Naional Parks API because it was easily accessible, had very few limits, had good photography, and involved one of my passions (the outdoors).
